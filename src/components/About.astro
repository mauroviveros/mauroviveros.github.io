    Over 5 years creating üí° functional, intuitive, and accessible web experiences. As a full stack
    developer specialized in frontend, my focus is on designing solutions that are not only
    efficient but also bring value to users and make other developers‚Äô work easier. I‚Äôm passionate
    about writing scalable, testable, and maintainable code, ensuring that every application is an
    experience people enjoy and want to return to. <br /> My programming journey began when my brother
    gave me a C book. Since then, my curiosity has led me to explore web development, learning from videos,
    forums, blogs, and documentation. <br /> My goal is for everyone to enjoy the application and want
    to come back ‚ù§Ô∏è.
